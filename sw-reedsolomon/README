Reed-Solomon decoder design for C-based synthesis

Top level decoder module: rs_decode.cpp
Simple Testbench: test_rs_decode.cpp

Presently dynamic values of k and t are not used in the decoding process. 
Instead the static constants in global_rs.h are used for simplicity.

Executing make compiles the decoder and the testbench and creates an executable.
Correct execution is indicated by the decoded output being a descending count 
from 223 to 1, repeated 3 times.

For synthesis, import into a C based design tool, set appropriate HW parameters
and synthesize for a particular platform.
